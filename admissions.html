			<h3>What is IIIT Dharwad?</h3>

They are instrumental in steering the institute in the right direction.</p>

			<h3>Why IIIT Dharwad?</h3>
			<p>Three short answers: Faculty, Innovation and Location!</p>

			<ul><li><h3>Faculty</h3>
			<p>Faculty at IIIT Dharwad are highly qualified with PhDs and Postdocs from institutes of repute in India and abroad and have the right blend of teaching, research, and industrial experience. The Director has ample experience in both academia and industry in India as well as USA. With energy and intent, they are working to set high standards in both teaching/learning and R&D.</p></li>
			
			<li><h3>Innovation</h3>
			<p>IIIT Dharwad aims to innovate in all its aspects: teaching, curriculum, campus design and R&D. The idea is to ensure that there is nothing boring or ordinary about IIIT Dharwad! Teaching-Learning: Being a technical institute of national importance, a special emphasis is given to practice-based teaching and learning process. Curriculum Design: The curriculum at IIIT Dharwad is evolving and dynamic to ensure that the courses taught are current and relevant. Campus Design:The Master Plan for IIIT Dharwad ensures that the Institute will have a unique, modern, green, and smart IT campus. About 70% of the area will be left for greenery even after all the buildings are constructed at the end of four phases. Needless to say that the campus will feature Wi-Fi, outdoor sports facilities, fully equipped academic and research laboratories, and modern IT-enabled classrooms. R&D: The hallmark of a good institute is its strength in research. Aptly IIIT Dharwad is being nurtured as a research institute to have close collaborations with IT industry and other R&D institutes.</p> </li>

			<li><h3>Location, Location, Location!</h3>
			<p>The permanent campus of IIIT Dharwad is coming up in a 60-acre plot between the two cities of Hubballi and Dharwad.  It is close to both cities and also the Hubballi Airport (UBX) yet away from all the traffic, noise and pollution. The location is indeed pristine, right where the hills start on the way to Western Ghats. It is also the catchment area of river Shalmala that flows down to join Arabian Sea near Karwar. The transit campus is located at IT Park in Hubballi near the famous Rani Chennamma circle. Dharwad is a well-known center for higher learning including music and arts. Hubballi-Dharwad are having a significant concentration of Higher Educational institutions and universities of repute including Indian Institute of Technology-Dharwad (IIT-Dharwad), Karnataka University, University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad (UAS-Dharwad), Karnataka State Law University, KLE Technological University, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital (KIMS-Hubballi), SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital, and SDM College of Engineering and Technology. Hubballi-Dharwad are twin cities, now being developed as smart cities in the state of Karnataka and together form the 2nd largest urban city next to Bangalore. The cities are located 410 kms from Bangalore city with excellent connectivity by air, rail and road to Bangalore, thereby enabling IIIT Dharwad to reap rich dividends from the strengths of Bangalore as the nation’s IT hub. There are several significant historical places located nearby viz., Badami, Aihole, Pattadkal, Hampi, Kudalasangama, and Vijayapura. Also, the cities are very close to Western Ghats, declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site and are one of the eight “hottest hot-spots” of rich biological diversity, flora, and fauna in the world. Dharwad city is 160 kms away from Panjim city, Goa which is a popular tourist destination.</p></li>

			<li><h3>Status of Permanent Campus:</h3>
			<p>The permanent campus of IIIT Dharwad is currently under construction with an expected completion date of July 2020. Until then, the institute is operating in a temporary facility at I.T. Park, Hubballi with adequate classroom and laboratory spaces. Currently, hostels are located in multiple private buildings away from I.T. Park in nearby areas of Hubli city. Also, no outdoor sports facilities are available at this time.</p></li></ul>
